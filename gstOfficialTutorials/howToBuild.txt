Part A: windows 10 w/vs2019

1. open .\tutorials\vs2019\tutorials.sln

2. follow the instructions as flows
	A. Download (https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/) and install
	  msvc64-bit (vs 2019, Release CRT) runtime and development installer

	B. Check and verify
	 1) env variable GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64 (=c:\gstreamer\1.0\msvc_x86_64\bin be default)
		and add $(GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64)/bin into your PATH
	 2) Although the folders and their names are organized unprofessional,  
		pay attention on the following folders/files
		$(GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64)/bin
		$(GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64)/include
		$(GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64)/lib
		$(GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64)\share\vs\2010\libs\gstreamer-1.0.props

	C.Download and build gst native tutorials
		1) In folder c:/temp: git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer.git
		2) Go to c:\temp\gstreamer\subprojects\gst-docs\examples\tutorials and copy vs2010 folder into vs2019
		3) double click c:\temp\gstreamer\subprojects\gst-docs\examples\tutorials\vs2019\tutorials.sln
		4) Build basic-tutorial-1 project
			i) Set it as  a startup project
			ii) Go to its property manager and add $(GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64)\share\vs\2010\libs\gstreamer-1.0.props
			iii) Now you x64-debug should be built, but you will have linker errors for release version.
			iv) Fix release error: Properties->linker->optimization: replace  old References setting “No (/OPT:NOREF)”  with “Yes (/OPT:REF)” from.
			v) Set Properties->Configuration properties->debugging->working directory as  $(GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64)\bin 
			vi) Now you can run either debug or release versions and  enjoy the trailer
